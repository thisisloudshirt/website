                <p>From Jessica Bozek&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lesfigues.com/book/the-tales/" target="_blank"><em>The Tales</em></a>:</p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="heading">THE ARCHAEOLOGIST&rsquo;S TALE<br><em>What the soldier left.</em></p>
                <p>Computers, bicycles, family photographs, pet birds, diaries, plates of half-eaten food, threadbare pajamas, little boxes of extra buttons, travel guides, chopsticks, game systems, power tools, picture books, flowering plants, bank cards, trophies, underthings, new toothbrushes for future guests, cleaning supplies, combs with hair stuck to the teeth, the current day’s newspaper open to the crossword, an afghan made by someone’s mother, cigarette lighters, holy books, freezers of meat, sweaters with holes in the writing elbow, muffin tins, junk mail, wine cellars, draft snakes, open notebooks, pocket knives, commemorative goblets, old batteries and light bulbs, handmade aprons, half-strung guitars, last summer’s preserves, watering cans, obsolete phones and their chargers, finger paintings on the refrigerator, holiday decorations, monogrammed towels, prescription drugs, coffee grinders, running shoes, lotions for dry skin, balms for chapped lips, gels for frizzy hair, salt shakers, stuffed bears, pruning shears, terrariums, candlesticks, shopping bags on hooks, unpaid bills, playing cards, drawers of winter clothes, bookends, decorative pillows, snack foods, family jewels, sports equipment, dog leashes, cat boxes, rodents in cages, spare keys, dull scissors, umbrellas, vitamins, diet soft drinks, mixing bowls, dictionaries, souvenir keychains, wooden blocks, suitcases, slipcovers, bath scales, unwashed takeout containers, shoe polish, spice racks.</p>
                <p>And the owners of these things.</p>
                <p class="heading">THE LONE SURVIVOR&rsquo;S TALE</p>
                <p>Those in charge have asked me to devise a memorial. I quickly reject statues, obelisks, all forms monumental in their ideology. Worse still, I imagine children visiting a memorial museum to experience sensory simulations of atrocity or to reenact victimhood bodily.</p>
                <p>I consider, instead, a constellation of small clothes, each with the name of one dead inscribed on a pocket or along a hem. These clothes I would string through a woodland and arrange by meaningful adjacency. A woman’s name might flutter near her partner’s, their children’s, her co-workers’.</p>
                <p>I need a memorial that will disintegrate over time, grey and fray as most of the dead did not have a chance to.</p>
                <p class="heading">THE SAVING: A FAIRY TALE<br><em>Air-coats.</em></p>
                <p>The air was colder in the days before the soldier came, so only those with the slowest metabolisms were not wearing coats when his stories began. Many had just returned home from work or school or their secret affairs.</p>
                <p>It is believed that beavers carry into the water so much air entangled in their coats that, if left undisturbed at the bottom of a lake, they can thrust their noses into their fur and breathe for some time. The people, of course, did not have fur, but they had winter coats.</p>
                <p>Since the event, some villagers have been spotted coming up out of the ground.</p>
