                <p>From Tomás González’s <em><a href="http://www.granta.com/New-Writing/Eyes-that-have-Seen-the-Sea" target="_blank">Eyes That Have Seen the Sea</a></em>:</p>
                <p>César Rengifo, forensic pathologist, started to notice the symptoms of a duodenal ulcer at the end of ‘55. He’d become paler and thinner than ever. The three aunts who had brought him up said he was getting ill because he was so disorganized, ate the wrong things, drank too much and hung around with bad women, the poor things. Basically, because he was a bachelor: “Get married,” they told him. He’d started to let his hair and beard grow too long, and had been greying since twenty-seven, so, what with the dark glasses he almost always wore, he was acquiring a look of eccentricity as well as ill health.</p>
                <p>His friends advised him to change his job, set up his own clinic somewhere or find a post in a hospital. They were convinced that the constant contact with death over so many years, eight hours a day, seven days a week, was starting to undermine his health. César replied that he couldn’t work in a hospital or clinic: he’d spent so many years working with dead people that he’d forgotten how living ones functioned, and anyway, it would all be over sooner or later.</p>
                <p>“Everything ends sooner or later,” he concluded.</p>
                <p>He said it without thinking, as though uttering a stock phrase, but his friends glimpsed the despair they’d seen in César before. As if he was saying that nothing would ever come to an end.</p>
                <p>When one of his friends suggested that they go away to the Pacific coast for a while, to see if it made him feel any better, César admitted that he’d never been to the sea. The latest wave of deaths had started when he was in his second year of medical school; and because he started work before graduating, he’d never had time.</p>
                <p>He’d been to biggish rivers, he said, but never to the sea.</p>
