                <p>I was always Cyclops; he was Wolverine. “Cyclops is weak,” Eric would say as soon as we started playing. “That visor looks dumb as shit. He’s a loser, dude.” I was good, anyway. Eric knew it, too, and I knew he knew. I’d handle most of the enemies while he’d be mashing keys, trying to kick off some infinite combo he’d heard about from his friend Chet. Once we’d run low on quarters, Eric would try to even the score&mdash;a game of Pop-A-Shot, maybe a couple rounds of skeeball. I sucked at skeeball, and Eric had a good four and a half inches on me, and he’d lean in so frigging far that I felt like he could probably tug the netting if he’d tried. I’d be pretty pissed about it, sure, but I wouldn’t show it.</p>
                <p>We’d head outside, wait on the curb by the drugstore for Eric’s mom to pick us up. He’d be auditioning yo momma jokes, working them and reworking them, while I just rolled my eyes and flicked gravel off the sidewalk. Eric always called shotgun, and so I’d sit behind Ms. Young and quietly rifle through the seatback pockets, blindly trace the outlines of the ice scraper, an empty canister of lip balm, the occasional dollar bill. Eric’s mom always asked if we’d had a good time, if we’d won. Honest, the whole thing was such a routine that I’m not sure she ever really heard a word of what we said. She’d ask anyway, and I’d watch her nod and say “uh huh, uh huh,” twirling her hair with one hand, her bare fingers flipping back and forth, hard and fast. Eric might see too, and he might see me seeing, and then he’d reach back and hit me in the arm like we were playing punch bug, even if we were the only car on the road.</p>
                <p>He caught me off guard once, and I yelped, and Ms. Young’s eyes shot at the rearview. My face flushed red, and I felt this sudden urge to yank out the ice scraper and stab Eric in the eye with it, to tell him that yo momma jokes weren’t even funny, and his were even less funny, to tell him that Cyclops might be weak, but at least he had his shit together, but instead I just sat back and, as we rounded the corner past the new apartment complex with the balconies and the swimming pool, sputtered: “Isn’t that where your dad lives now?” Eric’s head jerked like the spring launcher on a pinball machine, and Ms. Young moved her hand to the steering wheel, then back to the hair-twirling, harder and faster. I retreated into my seat and closed my eyes tight, wishing I were Cyclops, that I could laser myself out of the car, that I could laser the tiny parts of each of our brains that held the memory of everything that’d just happened.</p>
