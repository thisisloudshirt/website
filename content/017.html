                <p>I am the handsomest drowned man in the world, ashore at last. In the eyes of children, I am a mastless ship, a beached whale, a sandy sea-toy of divine proportions—a simulacrum of perfection. Underneath seaweed clumps and tangled jellyfish, I am Hope springing eternal; I am Pleasure; I am Joy.</p>
                <p>Grain by grain, the children bury me, but I am meant to be unburied. So they uncover me. The villagers carry me into town, and it takes hordes of men to move me. The mass of hands is like a coral reef hosting a sunken barge, fingers bending and threatening to break as they raise me up. The villagers speculate, of course: “Has he feasted on a team of horses? Have his bones absorbed the ocean? Has his soul solidified?” I am taller than any of them standing alone; I am taller than two or three combined. The village consists of some twenty-odd wooden houses—more timber lodge than tumbledown—but they look like sand castles in my shadow. The villagers carry me inside one, and I fill it with salt and sand and sea.</p>
                <p>The men gather, as men are said to do. “Has anyone gone missing from Tollytown? How about Riverbrook? Shantywick?” The women stay behind to care for me, what little care a specimen of my quality requires. They dust off bits of mud from my bronze skin and extract the pebbles buried in my still-luscious hair. They trim my nails with sheep shears. My clothes, manmade and not as sturdy as my body, are in tatters. So the women set forth to construct an outfit appropriate for a man as impressive as I. They work silently—awestruck, to be sure—with the wind as an accompaniment, steadily whooshing through the village.</p>
                <p>The men return, their search unfruitful. I must have come from some distant land, or a deserted island, or thin air. I was Creighton Abraham; they name me Esteban. I don’t mind. The name is just a placeholder for something greater.</p>
                <p>“He’s ours,” they exclaim, but they’re mine. They plan my funeral. It is a glorious event. Men and women from neighboring villages arrive in waves. They bring flowers, fruit, jewelry. I am surrounded by it all. I am afloat in a sea of devotion. The best and brightest of the villagers are selected to say a few words, but I can’t hear them amidst the sobs. They push me up their tallest hill on a carefully crafted cart with sixteen wheels. Wheel by wheel, I slip over the precipice and off into the beyond. As I fall, the villagers share stories about my accomplishments. There is much nodding and reassuring shoulder-patting and bewildered head-shaking. Much later, the villagers abandon the mountain and return to their homes in silence.</p>
                <p>In life, I was a fisherman lost in a storm. I was afraid of death. I was certain to drown. But I reassured myself with a simple thought: I would be the handsomest drowned man in the world.</p>
