                <p>Emma preens, she struts, ineffably brash in her lace crop top and ripped thrift-store jeans. She moves across the platform like a wind-up toy with swagger—whirring, frenetic, intimidating. The D passes through, on its way to Coney Island. Another one, heading toward Manhattan. A <em>whothefuckcares</em> on its way to <em>whothefuckcares</em>.</p>
                <p>It’s raining outside, likely pooling by the radiator back home. Just Emma’s now. Mona had moved to San Francisco months ago. It was abrupt and seamless, weeks before their lease was up. They’d spoken twice since then, but Mona seemed aloof, apparently determined that her emotional distance would match their physical distance.</p>
                <p>Emma glares at the tracks. They’d been close, Em and M—they grew up together, traded Ho Hos for Gushers and Mott’s for Hershey’s, shared inside jokes about teachers and sodas, celebrated birthdays and half-birthdays and third-birthdays, even worked together for a short stint in the Brooklyn Public Library, where they maintained a full fleet of card-catalog paper airplanes. And then something shifted; something unfastened.</p>
                <p>Emma raps her fingers on the sea-green columns as she walks, bouncing as she kicks at the trash cans, a sneering supernova. Mona was gone, seemingly after something that San Francisco had but Emma never would, or something that San Francisco didn’t have and Emma always would.</p>
                <p>The swelling sorrow, that gnawing vacancy, is temporary, and Emma knows it. Or she wants to know it, so she tells herself she knows it. She crouches, double-knotting her sneakers. She whips her head up; her bangs snap. The tracks are clear now. Nothing’s approaching.</p>
                <p>Emma backs up as far as she can, heels pressed against the tile, studying the gap, considering where she will begin her jump. She has paced it out many times before—four strides. She removes her hoop earrings, heaves them across, and watches them clatter on the opposite side. She wonders if they’ve gotten rid of the card catalog at the library, or if they’ve just let it slowly fade into disuse.</p>
                <p>Emma takes four long steps and she jumps, pushing her chest forward, chin up, arms back. She floats and wobbles, and her shin slaps against the edge of the opposite platform, the searing pain enough to convince her for a moment that she’s fallen short. But she swings forward, her palms tearing as she braces herself, skidding toward her earrings. Her head spins; her ears ring. She stands up and clenches her fists, victorious.</p>
                <p>Emma nods and looks around, grinning with irreverence. The station’s empty; Emma’s brimming.</p>
