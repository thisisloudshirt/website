                <p>So what is Flappy Bird? It is (was?) a phenomenon that all too quickly ran its course. The concept is the epitome of simple. You tap the screen to make the titular bird flap its tiny wings, and you try to avoid green pipes by flying over or ducking underneath them. If you slam into one, your flight ends, and you start up again to try to best your previous high score.<br>&mdash;<em><a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-flappy-bird/1100-6417647/" target="_blank">The Rise and Fall of Flappy Bird</a></em>, Gamespot</p>
                <p>Dong Nguyen, the game’s creator, spends most of his time on the social network either thanking people for their praise or defending himself against bird-addled players who say he’s ruined their lives. An independent game developer based in Vietnam, Nguyen was an obscure presence until recently. He liked it that way. When I managed to get in touch with him earlier this week, all he would tell me over email was that he was so taken aback by his newfound celebrity that he didn’t want to participate in any stories about the game.<br>&mdash;<em><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-unflappable-brilliance-of-flappy-bird" target="_blank">The Unflappable Brilliance of “Flappy Bird”</a></em>, Motherboard</p>
                <p>The gameplay premise of Flappy Bird is simple. You have a bird on the screen and tapping it makes the aforesaid Flappy Bird flap its wings and arc up and down. The background is a constant scroll and you have to flap the Flappy Bird through gaps made by large green pipes. If the Flappy Bird touches a pipe, or the ground, your game is over.<br>&mdash;<em><a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/review/games/iphone-game-flappy-bird-review-3500638/" target="_blank">Flappy Bird Review</a></em>, Macworld</p>
                <p>A Twitter feed is a poor map of someone’s mind, but there was certainly a noticeable change in Nguyen’s tone leading up to Saturday’s decision. Many of Nguyen’s earlier tweets were relaxed and friendly, thanking the game’s fans for their messages or politely declining requests to make a desktop version of the game. However, several of Nguyen’s recent missives show he was under pressure&mdash;or at least trying to give off that impression. He’s talked about “things happening” to him and repeatedly complained of people “overusing” Flappy Birds [<em>sic</em>], which certainly had addictive qualities.<br>&mdash;<em><a href="http://techland.time.com/2014/02/09/flappy-bird-deleted/" target="_blank">Popular Flappy Bird Game Mysteriously Grounded</a></em>, Time</p>
                <p>Nguyen had created a simple game in which the player controls a funny-looking bird by tapping the screen, and it needed a simple name. He called it Flap Flap, until he realized another app had the same title. Luckily, developing and updating games on the App Store is such a fast, iterative process that he was able to quickly retitle it Flappy Bird.<br>&mdash;<em><a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2014/02/flappy-bird/" target="_blank">Inside the Brief Life and Untimely Death of Flappy Bird</a></em>, Wired</p>
                <p>Flappy Bird, the popular mobile game, is being pulled from app marketplaces by its developer.<br>&mdash;<em><a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/personal-tech/gaming/Flappy-Bird-creator-to-take-down-game/articleshow/30104742.cms" target="_blank">Flappy Bird Creator to Take Down Game</a></em>, The Times of India</p>
                <p>There is only one goal. Tap the screen to make Flappy fly and navigate it safely through an obstacle course of metal pipes. Cruise through a narrow gap between pipes to get a single point. Touch a pipe, however, and the little bird dies with a loud smack, nose-diving from the pale blue sky to the ground.<br>&mdash;<em><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/05/tech/gaming-gadgets/flappy-bird-game/" target="_blank">The Maddening Pull of “Flappy Bird”</a></em>, CNN</p>
